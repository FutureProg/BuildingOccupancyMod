    # Realistic Building Occupancy
    This mod modifies the number of occupants in each building.

    ## READ FIRST
    Running the mod with a pre-existing save is possible but will take some effort to recover from. **If you are
    using a pre-existing save file:**
    1. Upon loading the save, open the Realistic Building Occupancy settings.
    2. Under the maintenance section choose one of the two options after reading their descriptions carefully. "Seek New Households" is recommended.
    3. Return to the simulation and press play. Any building that had too many renters will now have the correct amount. (you might have to wait a bit)
